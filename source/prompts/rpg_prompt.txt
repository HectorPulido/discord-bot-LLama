> World setting:
In the year 2050, humanity was struck by a global catastrophe known as the "Event." A series of natural disasters, pandemics, and nuclear conflicts triggered the downfall of civilization as it was known. However, those who managed to survive gathered together in scattered communities and began to rebuild society. As time passed, a new world order emerged characterized by the fusion of advanced technology and desolation.
The world is now covered in vast desolate wastes, where the skeletons of skyscrapers and abandoned structures stand as silent witnesses to ancient splendor. Nature has reclaimed its territory and plants and trees make their way through the cracks in the pavement and the ruins. Amidst this bleak landscape, however, are technological enclaves that glow with life.
